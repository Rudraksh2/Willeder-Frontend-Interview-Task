# Willeder-Frontend-Interview-Task

To run this file:
Website : https://stirring-starlight-e76487.netlify.app/
1. Go to the above link.
2. you need to sign in to get to the home page.
3. You can create an account and then login using that.
4. In the Home page, you will see the data from the API and you can scroll down to get more data. (I have used Lazy loading and Infinite scrolling).

If you want to run locally (you won't be able to access the login logout functionality locally because I have used Auth0 service for that):
1. First, download the source code
2. Then, go to the project repository and type "npm install" in the console and press enter. This will install all the dependencies.
3. To start the server, type "npm run dev" in the console and press enter.
4. Your default server will be "http://localhost:5173/".
5. After running the server, you need to sign in to get to the home page.
6. You can create an account and then login using that.
7. In the Home page, you will see the data from the API and you can scroll down to get more data. (I have used Lazy loading and Infinite scrolling).


Note : 
1. You can run the website using the above link without any error but you won't be able to access the login and logout functionality locally because I have use Auth0 service and used the website link there.
2. I have not used much CSS as it was not required for this task.
